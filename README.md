## Project description
The goal of this project was to create a program that would perform some of the boring activities in the War Universe game like collecting bonus crates or killing aliens. However, it was not created to gain an advantage over other players, but to learn new things in python programming.
<p></p>

The project uses the Flet library, which enables developers to easily build realtime web, mobile and desktop apps in Python. In addition, the project is mainly based on detecting periodic pixel colors on the screen using the OpenCV library.

This bot, for now, allows you to collect various types of minerals and kill aliens. However, the system of collecting as well as killing is constantly being improved in order to achieve the highest possible efficiency.

## Features currently implemented
    . the ability to choose different types of boxes to be collected by the bot
    . the ability to enable killing of aliens
    . flying to different areas of the map

## Ideas to develop
- adding a new feature that allows you to escape from the enemy
- better system of collecting boxes and killing enemys
- addition of search for nearest teleport during escape
- adding communication with the bot via discord/telegram (check stats, enable/disable bot remotely)
